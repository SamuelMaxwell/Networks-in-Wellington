		<h1>Seeing Networks in Wellington</h1>
		<p><em>Wellingtons network infrastructure is a lot like the city itself: messy, sprawling, and at times near-incomprehensible. However, the cityâ€™s tendency toward flux is a strange blessing for the infrastructure sightseer: markings and remnants of the network are almost everywhere, once you know how to look for them.</em></p>

	<section>
		<p>The following information is ongoing research. I encourage Readers to get in touch if they want to contribute images and observations to this website.</p>

	<section>
		<p><strong>Content number one: Manhole Covers</strong></p>
		<p>Manholes are points in the city that lead to the underground world and the connections that part of the internet connects to. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/hash-tag-links-padding/">More info about that here</a></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<p><strong>Content number two: Street Markings</strong></p>
		<p>Manhole Covers are generally surrounded with these markings to indicate the kinds of cables that are down that manhole. This is usful for contractors and construction companies when they plan on doing street excavations, utility companies will put these markings down </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<p><strong>Content number three: Antennas</strong></p>
		<p>There are many different kinds of ways to connect to the internet, and one such way is through antennas. Unluke manhole covers and markings these don't get worn down and also don't need to be in the middle of the road</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<p><strong>Content number four: Cameras</strong></p>
		<p>Cameras aren't specifically public networks and are often not in the publics control to connect to. The city is full of such networked objects, and don't stop at just serveillance of passers by. Many such cameras are used for sensoring vehicular traffic, recording water usage, opening and closing doors ect. This section allows us to look into who controls these ubiquitous networks</p>

			<h1>Street Markings</h1>
			<p>These are drawn on the ground by utility companies around manholes and underground networks. These are essential for people that work on the cables to understand where these cables will go and what kind of cables they will need to be aware of for health and safty reasons.</p>
